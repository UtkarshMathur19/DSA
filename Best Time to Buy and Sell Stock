You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Code ->

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxprofit = 0;
        int minprice = INT_MAX;
        int size = prices.size();
        
        for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
            minprice = min(minprice, prices[i]);
            maxprofit = max(maxprofit, prices[i]-minprice);
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
};
