You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

Code ->

class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxi = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int dp[10005];
        vector<int> freq(10005);
        for(auto i:nums)
            freq[i]++;
        dp[1] = freq[1];
        dp[2] = max(dp[1], freq[2]*2);
        
        for(int j=3;j<=maxi;j++){
            dp[j] = max(dp[j-1], dp[j-2]+freq[j]*j);
        }
        return dp[maxi];
    }
};
