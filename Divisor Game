Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number n on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

Choosing any x with 0 < x < n and n % x == 0.
Replacing the number n on the chalkboard with n - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

Code ->

class Solution {
public:
    bool divisorGame(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=n-1;i>0;i--){
            if(n%i == 0)
                n = n-i;
            count++;
        }
        if(count%2!=0)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
        
    }
};
